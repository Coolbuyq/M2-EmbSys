#  About Smart Blind Stick
---
##  Discription
The Project is an  smart blind stick . Traditionally visually impaired people used a stick to find out if any obstacles are present in front of them. But this stick is inefficient in various aspects and the person using it has to face several problems. The objective of this project is to provide the visually impaired a better navigational tool. The ultrasonic blind walking stick is way more advanced than the traditional walking stick as the use of sensors makes object detection easier.
  The Ultrasonic sensor used in it is used to detect the obstacle in front of blind person within 50cm area.Thus this system allows for obstacle detection. Then another feature of this stick is to detect water on the ground by using water sensor. This stick also indicate day or night vision for blind person by using LDR sensor.
  
##  Identifying Featurs
  * It shall Detect the obstacle in front of blind person
  * It shall detect the water or sliperry road 
  * Wheb blind person enters into dark It shall detect 
  
##  State of art
  * This system will help all blind person
  * Further enhancement can sovle all probems of blind person
  *  Secure the blind person from any accident
  
##  5W's & 1H & S.W.O.T Analysis

 ### WHAT
 * Smart blind stick
 ### WHO
 * For blind Peoples
 ### WHEN
 * When Blind person want's to go anywhere
 ### WHERE 
 * On road,home,malls whenever blind person wants to go
 ### WHY
 * To help blind peoples and prevent there life from accident
 ### HOW
 * When there is obstacles or when blind person are about to go in dark area the system will notify blind person by beeping buzzer
 
 ## S.W.O.T Analysis
