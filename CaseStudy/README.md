## Fingerprint based Bank Locker System
The fingerprint based bank locker system is an enhancement to the traditional bank locker system that uses keys.
Now keys can easily be copied and made by theifâ€™s who know about it. Also the keys must be taken care of and can also be lost due to some negligence. Well fingerprint based bank locker system is here to solve all these issues. The fingerprinted authenticated bank locker system is safe as well as easy to use and maintain. No key handling no need to worry about key getting lost. The system uses fingerprint sensing to read fingerprints and first store registered fingerprints against the bank locker record. Now next time a person scans finger the sensor reads it and compares it with past records. Now if match is found with existing prints, it sends the match signal to the microcontroller and the controller displays this data on the LCD display. Also the controller drives the driver motor to open the bank locker door and opens it for authorized customers. The door of locker wont open for unauthorized customers.

## Accident Identification and alerting System
When an individual riding his/her bike, meets with an accident, there is a chance that the individual may suffer from a serious injury or expire instantaneously and there is no one around to help him. Well this system is a solution to the problem. The system acts as an accident identification system that gathers and sends this vehicle information that met with an accident, and conveys it to the nearest control room.
For this the user vehicle is fixed with an RF transmitter circuit that has a vibration sensor along with microcontroller, RF encoder and also fitted with an RF transmitter. Each and every control room must have an RF receiver fitted to receive the transmission. Whenever a user vehicle meets with any accident, the vibration sensor detects and gives its output. This output is then detected by the microcontroller. Now the microcontroller sends this change detection signal to an RF transmitter. The RF transmitter now intern begins transmitting this accident data. The nearest RF transmitter reads the signal and then shows it on an LCD screen. The person monitoring the LCD screen may react to it, reach the accident location and help the needful.
